In the file preprocessing.py I have defined the functions needed to pre-process sentinel 1 data using snappy

With this functions you can achieve:

<p>1: Data preparation</p>
<p>2: Pre-processing - Calibration</p>
<p>3: Pre-processing - Speckle filtering</p>
<p>4: Post-processing - Geometric correction</p>

<p>Please open the Figures folder to check the output of this functions.</p>
